Methods: The study was conducted at National Taiwan University Hospital between January and July 2020. We collected a dataset of 6010 ECG samples from women preparing for natural spontaneous delivery (NSD). The ECG data was used to develop an ECG waveform-based Nociception Monitoring Index (NoM). The dataset was divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets. Multiple machine learning models, including LightGBM, XGBoost, SnapLogisticRegression, and SnapDecisionTree, were developed and evaluated. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using grid search and five-fold cross-validation to enhance model performance. Results: The LightGBM model demonstrated superior performance with an AUC of 0.96 and an accuracy of 90%, making it the optimal model for monitoring labor pain based on ECG data. Other models, such as XGBoost and SnapLogisticRegression, also showed strong performance, with AUC values ranging from 0.88 to 0.95. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the integration of machine learning algorithms with ECG data significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of labor pain monitoring. Specifically, the LightGBM model exhibits exceptional precision and robustness in continuous pain monitoring during labor, with potential applicability extending to broader healthcare settings.

Machine learning aims to train models to make predictions based on historical data. Although many studies have focused on predictions and model building, this research introduces a novel integrated framework using a Stacked Heterogeneous Ensemble Model (SHEM). It aims to enhance prediction accuracy by employing another novel approach for imputing missing values, the Variable Specific Hot Deck (VSHD) imputation method. The outcomes were contrasted with established machine learning techniques, including random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. After completing the imputation, we proceeded to implement the SHEM model. Real-time climate data for the Cuddalore location in Tamil Nadu state, South India was collected from the NASA Power Access viewer portal to verify the accuracy level of the proposed model. Performance analysis indicates that the proposed imputation outperforms all four alternative models with a 30% average improvement in accuracy. Moreover, the developed SHEM model has a reduced RMSE value of 0.321 and an R-squared value of 0.952 and shows a 9% improvement in accuracy compared to the base model's performance. Furthermore, these prediction results are compared to an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), a deep learning model to calculate accuracy and loss, showing that the proposed achieves high accuracy and significant loss during validation. The obtained results can serve as a guideline for atmospheric scientists and various weather forecasting applications, helping them to choose the most appropriate machine learning method for their prediction task. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Imputation; Machine learning; Rainfall prediction; Regression; Stacking ensemble model; Weather forecasting","Climate models; Decision trees; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; NASA; Nearest neighbor search; Rain; Support vector machines; Deep learning; Ensemble models; Heterogeneous ensembles; Imputation; Integrated frameworks; Machine-learning; Rainfall prediction; Regression; Stacking ensemble model; Stackings; Weather forecasting","Article","Scopus"

Typical “universal” domain-agnostic methods are known to suffer from instabilities and are prone to adversarial perturbations. Natural heterogeneity inherent in biological tissue structures complicates the interpretation of images even by trained physicians. Yet, algorithms in the medical domain require a high level of stability and interpretability to ensure their adoption by clinical experts and acceptance in clinical decision-making. In this work, we propose a novel method for segmentation and classification to address these challenges. The method is based on a hierarchical approach and biologically-informed feature extraction. The method's technical pipeline includes the automatic extraction of key biologically-informed features typically considered by physicians. This is followed by image classification using these features. Both stages rely on randomized ML techniques. The proposed hierarchical biomedically-informed approach significantly improved the image classification quality compared to the baseline solution of image classification in the task of colorectal cancer (CRC) analysis. The average F1-score for the four tissue types increased from 0.737 to 0.956. Using tumor tissue classification task as an example, we showed that the proposed algorithm offers an effective and practical avenue to solve these challenging issues. © 2024","Computer vision; Digital pathology; Machine learning; Randomized learning; Slide analysis; Tissue analysis","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Image segmentation; Digital pathologies; Domain agnostics; Hierarchical algorithm; Images classification; Machine-learning; Randomized learning; Slide analyze; Tissue analysis; Tissue classification; Tissue segmentation; Adversarial machine learning","Article","Scopus"

In artificial intelligence robots, mobile adaptive networks can be used to optimize the perception and decision-making abilities of robots. By continuously learning and adapting to environmental changes, robots can better understand and respond to the interactive needs of music classrooms, providing more accurate and targeted auxiliary services. By learning and analyzing rich training data, robots can possess higher-level cognitive and comprehension abilities. In terms of music recommendation, the K-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to recommend music works that are suitable for students. By analyzing students’ music preferences and learning needs, robots provide personalized music recommendations to students based on this information, helping them better participate in and enjoy music classes.

However, they often overlook class overlap and fail to adequately consider the feature distributions of different classes. Consequently, when resampling is performed under such conditions, samples within areas of overlap remain susceptible to misclassification, failing to substantially improve overall performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel data resampling technique, Nearest Neighbors and Density-based Undersampling (NDU). This method employs within-class k-nearest neighbors and between-class probability densities to design a weight assignment strategy. Leveraging this strategy, we establish an exclusive metric, the F_factor, to evaluate the importance of majority class samples in overlap areas. Subsequently, NDU promotes a gradient-based segmented undersampling strategy, which applies varying degrees of undersampling to majority class samples across segmented regions. Through experiments on binary imbalanced datasets with class overlap, we evaluate the efficiency of diverse resampling methods concerning classification performance. The results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively addresses class overlap challenges. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Class overlap; Imbalanced classification; K-nearest neighbor; Probability density; Undersampling","Class overlap; Data classification; Density-based; Imbalanced classification; Imbalanced data; K-near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Probability densities; Resampling method; Under-sampling; algorithm; Article; artificial neural network; classification algorithm; dispersity; entropy; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; machine learning; nerve cell network; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; support vector machine; k-nearest neighbors","Article","Scopus"

The primary objective of this cross-sectional, monocentric study was to assess digital gait sensor data’s utility for monitoring and diagnosis of motor and gait impairment in PD. As a secondary objective, for the more challenging tasks of detecting comorbidities, non-motor outcomes, and disease progression subgroups, we evaluated for the first time the integration of digital markers with metabolomics and clinical data. Using shoe-attached digital sensors, we collected gait measurements from 162 patients and 129 controls in a single visit. Machine learning models showed significant diagnostic power, with AUC scores of 83–92% for PD vs. control and up to 75% for motor severity classification. Integrating gait data with metabolomics and clinical data improved predictions for challenging-to-detect comorbidities such as hallucinations.

It is highly unlikely that academics and marketers fully comprehend the myriad of options that machine learning (ML) applications provide for establishing and preserving a competitive economic edge. Despite the catastrophic, unequal, oppressive effects of algorithmic bias on different client groups, research in this area is still lacking despite the enormous increase of algorithmic decision making in marketing. This study fills this gap by presenting a paradigm that uses the micro foundations of dynamic capacity to uncover the causes of algorithmic bias in marketing. Purpose of this research is to create a fresh method to entertainment analysis for machine learning-based business management decision making. In this study, a game model using fuzzy swarm Gaussian recursive neural networks is developed for entertainment analysis in social network-based business intelligence and decision making modelling. The MSE, MAE, f-1 score, accuracy, precision, recall, and precision are all included in the experimental study.

Existing approaches have conventionally been conducted on stationary feature space and they assume that we can obtain the entire labels of data streams in the case of supervised learning. However, in many real scenarios, e.g., the environment monitoring task, new features flood in, and old features are partially lost during the changing environment as the different lifespans of different sensors. Besides, each instance needs to be labeled by experts, resulting in expensive costs and scarcity of labels. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel Online Imbalance learning with unpredictable Feature evolution and Label scarcity (OIFL) algorithm. First, we utilize margin-based online active learning to selectively label valuable instances. After obtaining the labels, we handle imbalanced class distribution by optimizing F-measure and transforming F-measure optimization into a weighted surrogate loss minimization. When data streams arrive with augmented features, we combine the online passive-aggressive algorithm and structural risk minimization to update the classifier in the divided feature space. When data streams arrive with incomplete features, we leverage variance to identify the most informative features following the empirical risk minimization principle and continue to update the existing classifier as before. Finally, we obtain a sparse but reliable learner by the strategy of projecting truncation. We derive theoretical analyses of OIFL. Also, experiments on the synthetic datasets and real-world data streams to validate the effectiveness of our method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Feature evolution; Label scarcity; Online imbalance learning","Active learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Self-supervised learning; Data stream; Different class; F measure; Feature evolution; Feature space; Imbalanced data; Label scarcity; Online imbalance learning; Online learning; Stationary features; algorithm; Article; data base; e-learning; environmental monitoring; environmental surveillance; event related potential; evolution; feature evolution; human; learning; machine learning; mathematical parameters; Online imbalance learning; process optimization; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; Adversarial machine learning","Article","Scopus"

However, there are some disadvantages in such an algorithm. For example, the number of hidden layer nodes needs to be manually adjusted during the training process, meanwhile the large uncertainty will be caused by two random mappings. To solve these problems, based on the optimization ability of the kernel function, a double-kernel broad learning system (DKBLS) is proposed to eliminate the uncertainty of random mapping by using additive kernel strategy. Meanwhile, to reduce the computing costs and training time of DKBLS, a double-kernel based bayesian approximation broad learning system with dropout (Dropout-DKBLS) is further proposed. Ablation experiments show that the output accuracy of Dropout-DKBLS does not decrease even if the node is dropped. In addition, function approximation experiments show that DKBLS and Dropout-DKBLS have good robustness and can accurately predict noise data. The regression and classification experiments on multiple datasets are compared with the latest kernel-based learning methods. The comparison results show that both DKBLS and Dropout-DKBLS have good regression and classification performance. By further comparing the training time of these kernel-based learning methods, we prove that the Dropout-DKBLS can reduce the computational cost while ensuring the output accuracy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian approximation; Broad learning system; Double-kernel; Dropout","Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Bayesian; Bayesian approximation; Broad learning system; Double-kernel; Dropout; Kernel-based learning; Output accuracy; Random Mappings; Training time; Uncertainty; algorithm; article; controlled study; female; learning; machine learning; noise; Adversarial machine learning","Article","Scopus"

Methods: A cohort of 4,240 Sepsis-3 patients was analyzed, with 783 experiencing 30-day mortality and 3,457 surviving. Fifteen biomarkers were selected using feature ranking methods, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest, and Extra Tree, and the Logistic Regression (LR) model was used to assess their individual predictability with a fivefold cross-validation approach for the validation of the prediction. The dataset was balanced using the SMOTE-TOMEK LINK technique, and a stacking-based meta-classifier was used for 30-day mortality prediction.

FS is considered a challenging problem that is difficult to solve efficiently due to its combinatorial nature. As the problem size increases, so does the computation time.

Therefore, this paper introduces an adaptive chaotic dynamic gazelle optimization algorithm (ACD-GOA) with enhanced elite Strategy for FS problems. The ACD-GOA is a novel enhanced version of the recently published GOA, incorporating multiple improved strategies to enhance its search capabilities and convergence speed. The initialization phase and iteration initialization adopt the dynamic opposition learning strategy to avoid premature convergence. Additionally, several enhancement strategies are employed to improve the efficiency of the standard GOA. Adaptive inertia weight and sigmoid function are used to enhance search efficiency. Furthermore, enhanced elite and exchanging information strategies are implemented to maintain population diversity and avoid local solutions, respectively. Experimental evaluations are conducted using various functions, including the twelve CEC2022 standard functions and fourteen FS benchmark datasets. The performance of ACD-GOA is compared with several other metaheuristic algorithms. Statistical tests such as Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests are used to analyze the experimental data. The experimental results highlight the proposed algorithm's exceptional capacity to overcome problems associated with local minima and expedite the convergence process.

Despite the potential for AI to improve care, ethical concerns and mistrust in AI-enabled healthcare exist among the public and medical community. Given the rapid and transformative recent growth of AI in cardiovascular care, to inform practice guidelines and regulatory policies that facilitate ethical and trustworthy use of AI in medicine, we conducted a literature review to identify key ethical and trust barriers and facilitators from patients’ and healthcare providers’ perspectives when using AI in cardiovascular care. Methods: In this rapid literature review, we searched six bibliographic databases to identify publications discussing transparency, trust, or ethical concerns (outcomes of interest) associated with AI-based medical devices (interventions of interest) in the context of cardiovascular care from patients’, caregivers’, or healthcare providers’ perspectives. The search was completed on May 24, 2022 and was not limited by date or study design. Results: After reviewing 7,925 papers from six databases and 3,603 papers identified through citation chasing, 145 articles were included. Key ethical concerns included privacy, security, or confidentiality issues (n = 59, 40.7%); risk of healthcare inequity or disparity (n = 36, 24.8%); risk of patient harm (n = 24, 16.6%); accountability and responsibility concerns (n = 19, 13.1%); problematic informed consent and potential loss of patient autonomy (n = 17, 11.7%); and issues related to data ownership (n = 11, 7.6%). Major trust barriers included data privacy and security concerns, potential risk of patient harm, perceived lack of transparency about AI-enabled medical devices, concerns about AI replacing human aspects of care, concerns about prioritizing profits over patients’ interests, and lack of robust evidence related to the accuracy and limitations of AI-based medical devices. Ethical and trust facilitators included ensuring data privacy and data validation, conducting clinical trials in diverse cohorts, providing appropriate training and resources to patients and healthcare providers and improving their engagement in different phases of AI implementation, and establishing further regulatory oversights. Conclusion: This review revealed key ethical concerns and barriers and facilitators of trust in AI-enabled medical devices from patients’ and healthcare providers’ perspectives. Successful integration of AI into cardiovascular care necessitates implementation of mitigation strategies. These strategies should focus on enhanced regulatory oversight on the use of patient data and promoting transparency around the use of AI in patient care. © The Author(s) 2024.","Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Machine learning; Medical devices; Transparency; Trust","Artificial Intelligence; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Trust; artificial intelligence; cardiovascular disease; ethics; human; therapy; trust","Article","Scopus"

This paper introduces a novel framework to analyze sentiment shifts in social network comment sections, a reflection of the broader public discourse over time. Leveraging a pre-trained uncased RoBERTalarge model, we predict emotional scores from user comments, mapping these to key sentiment trends such as Approval, Toxicity, Obscenity, Threat, Hate, Offensive, and Neutral. Our methodology employs machine learning techniques to train a dataset that connects emotional scores with these trends, generating trend probability scores. We utilize a bottom-up recursive algorithm to aggregate emotional scores within comment threads, enabling the prediction of trend scores using three distinct aggregation methods. The results demonstrate that our emotional prediction model achieves an AUC of 0.92, and XGBoost stands out with an F1 score exceeding 0.40.

Game metrics have been widely adopted due to their human-readable and task-oriented nature. However, these metrics vary between games and require expert knowledge. Game analytics has evolved with techniques that primarily handle non-tabular and sequential data, like graphs and time series. However, existing methods still depend on traditional game metrics from extensive feature engineering. In parallel, graph representation learning has been applied to game provenance graphs — structures that log game events as nodes and link them through causal relationships. This approach may allow analysts to bypass traditional game metrics and learn relevant downstream features during training. This paper compares this metric-less graph-based representation learning with traditional metric-based machine learning in two predictive game analytics tasks: win prediction and hit prediction. Our results show that the same graph-based representation learning architecture achieves competitive results in win prediction and outperforms metric-based approaches in hit prediction, suggesting its suitability for predictive game analytics tasks. This method could significantly benefit as it does not require game-specific metric expertise, and its learned features are versatile across multiple tasks. © 2024","Event prediction; Game analytics; Graph representation learning; Machine learning; Win prediction","Graphic methods; Predictive analytics; Empirical comparison; Event prediction; Game analytic; Game metrics; Graph representation; Graph representation learning; Graph-based representations; Hit predictions; Machine-learning; Win prediction; Machine learning","Article","Scopus"

The exploration of the memory encoding mechanism or the representation mechanism of information in the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is the basis for the in-depth study of memory. In this paper, we study the memory encoding mechanism of multilayer SNN models from a biomimetic perspective and explore a method using the high biological likelihood of SNN to enable the network to effectively simulate memory effects. We proposed a series of heuristic neuron-growing connection algorithms and supervised network weight learning algorithms, which were applied to the unsupervised and supervised training process of the presentation layer. These methods optimized the structure of the representation layer, achieved functional differentiation of neurons, and enabled the network to generate differentiated representations for different data modes. Under our algorithm, the proposed model achieves stable convergence with identical pattern inputs, demonstrating distinct representations and sensitivities to different visual modalities. To achieve stable information expression within the network, we conducted various comparative experiments to determine diverse parameters of the complex network.

Can this model generalize to new PDEs without any fine-tuning? In-context operator learning and the corresponding model In-Context Operator Networks (ICON) represent an initial exploration of these questions. The capability of ICON regarding the first question has been demonstrated previously. In this paper, we present a detailed methodology for solving PDE problems with ICON, and show how a single ICON model can make forward and reverse predictions for different equations with different strides, provided with appropriately designed data prompts. We show positive evidence for the second question above, through a study on 1D scalar nonlinear conservation laws, a family of PDEs with temporal evolution. In particular, we show that an ICON model trained on conservation laws with cubic flux functions can generalize well to some other flux functions of more general forms, without fine-tuning. We also show how to broaden the range of problems that an ICON model can address, by transforming functions and equations to ICON's capability scope. We believe that the progress in this paper is a significant step towards the goal of training a foundation model for PDE-related tasks under the in-context operator learning framework. © 2024 The Author(s)","Conservation laws; In-context learning; Machine learning; Operator learning","Conservation law; Context learning; Context operators; In contexts; In-context learning; Machine-learning; Network models; Nonlinear conservation law; Operator learning; Operator networks","Article","Scopus"

In recent years, researchers have constructed a variety of different prediction models. However, given the limited size of human oral bioavailability data sets, the challenge of making accurate predictions with small sample sizes has become a critical issue in the field. The deep forest model, with its adaptively determinable number of cascade levels, can perform exceptionally well even on small-scale data. However, the original deep forest suffers unbalanced multi-grained scanning process and premature stopping of cascade forest training. In this paper, we propose a human oral bioavailability predict method based on an improved deep forest, called balanced multi-grained scanning mapping cascade forest (bgmc-forest). Firstly, the mordred descriptor method is selected to feature extraction, then enhanced features are obtained by the improved balanced multi-grained scanning, which solves the problem of missing features at both ends. And finally, the prediction results are obtained by feature mapping cascaded forests, which is based on principal component analysis and cascade forests, ensures the effectiveness of the cascade forest. The superiority of the model constructed in this paper is demonstrated through comparative experiments, while the effectiveness of the improved module is verified through ablation experiments.

Proper design and management of sewer systems are essential to prevent flooding, reduce environmental pollution, and ensure public health and safety. One crucial parameter in sewer system design and management is the particle Froude number (Frn). The goal of this study is to develop a predictive algorithm that takes into account the relevant input parameters, such as volumetric sediment concentration (Cv), dimensionless grain size of particles (Dgr), the ratio of sediment median size to the hydraulic radius (d/R), pipe friction factor (λ) to accurately predict the Frn using an ablation study for the condition of non-deposition with clean bed data. The proposed approach is based on hyper-parameter optimization techniques, i.e., Babysitting method (BSM), GridSearchCV (GS), random search (RS), Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process (BO-GP), Bayesian optimization with tree-structures Parzen estimator (BO-TPE), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), which are applied to the four machine learning algorithms such as random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector regression (SVR).

In order to mitigate the loss of life and resources caused by recurrent major and minor flood events, it is imperative to develop a comprehensive spatial flood zonation map of the entire area. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to prepare a flood susceptible map of the southwest coastal region of India using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data and robust machine learning algorithms. Accurate flood and non-flood locations have been identified from the multi-temporal Sentinel-1 images. These flood locations are correlated with sixteen flood conditioning geo-environmental variables. The Boruta algorithm has been applied to determine the importance of each flood conditioning parameter. Six efficient machine learning models, namely support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), partial least squares (PLS) and penalized discriminant analysis (PDA) have been applied to delineate the flood susceptible areas of the study region. The performance of the models has been evaluated using several statistical criteria, including area under curve (AUC), overall accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and kappa index. The results have revealed that all models have performed more than 90% of AUC due to the high precision of radar data. However, the RF and SVM models have outperformed other models in terms of all statistical parameters. The findings have identified approximately 13% of the study region as highly vulnerable to flood hazards, emphasizing the need for proper planning and management in these areas. © 2024 The Authors","Flood disaster; GIS; Machine learning; SAR; Southwest coastal region of India","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Digital storage; Flood control; Flood damage; Nearest neighbor search; Network security; Random forests; Coastal regions; Flood disaster; Flood hazards; Loss of life; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Multi-temporal; Radar data; Random forests; Southwest coastal region of india; Support vector machines","Article","Scopus"

TFD offers many benefits, such as improving code quality, reducing debugging time, and enabling easier refactoring. However, TFD also poses challenges and limitations, requiring more effort and time to write and maintain test cases, especially for large and complex projects. Refactoring for testability is improving the internal structure of source code to make it easier to test. Refactoring for testability can reduce the cost and complexity of software testing and speed up the test-first life cycle. However, measuring testability is a vital step before refactoring for testability, as it provides a baseline for evaluating the current state of the software and identifying the areas that need improvement. This paper proposes a mathematical model for calculating class testability based on test effectiveness and effort and a machine-learning regression model that predicts testability using source code metrics. It also introduces a testability-driven development (TsDD) method that conducts the TFD process toward developing testable code. TsDD focuses on improving testability and reducing testing costs by measuring testability frequently and refactoring to increase testability without running the program. Our testability prediction model has a mean squared error of 0.0311 and an R2 score of 0.6285. We illustrate the usefulness of TsDD by applying it to 50 Java classes from three open-source projects. TsDD achieves an average of 77.81 % improvement in the testability of these classes.

The classifiers are developed by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, requiring a large dataset for training to build reliable and accurate models. However, collecting large enough EEG datasets is difficult due to intra-/inter-subject variabilities and experimental costs. This leads to the data scarcity problem, which causes overfitting issues to training samples, resulting in reducing generalization performance. To solve the EEG data scarcity problem and improve the performance of the EEG classifiers, we propose a novel EEG data augmentation (DA) framework using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). An experimental study is implemented with two public EEG datasets, including motor imagery (MI) tasks (BCI competition IV IIa and III IVa), to validate the effectiveness of the proposed EEG DA method for the EEG classifiers. To evaluate the proposed cGAN-based DA method, we tested eight EEG classifiers for the experiment, including traditional MLs and state-of-the-art DLs with three existing EEG DA methods. Experimental results showed that most DA methods with proper DA proportion in the training dataset had higher classification performances than without DA. Moreover, applying the proposed DA method showed superior classification performance improvement than the other DA methods. This shows that the proposed method is a promising EEG DA method for enhancing the performances of the EEG classifiers in MI-based BCIs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Brain-computer interface (BCI); Data augmentation (DA); Electroencephalogram (EEG); Generative adversarial networks (GANs); Motor imagery (MI)","Adversarial machine learning; Deep learning; Electroencephalography; Large datasets; Adversarial networks; Augmentation methods; Brain-computer interface; Classification performance; Data augmentation; Electroencephalogram; Generative adversarial network; Motor imagery; accuracy; analytic method; Article; artificial neural network; classification; classification algorithm; classifier; controlled study; data augmentation; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant analysis; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; Generative adversarial network; human; human experiment; imagery; learning algorithm; machine learning; measurement accuracy; receiver operating characteristic; support vector machine; training; Generative adversarial networks","Article","Scopus"

This approach is unsupervised and only relies on input data patterns.

In this paper, we apply Artificial Intelligence and statistics techniques to build prediction models to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the United States, using multiple estimates of COVID-19 prevalence and other explanatory variables. We propose the use of stacking techniques based on multiple model building techniques (Linear and Beta Regression, Genetic Programming and Neural Networks) to obtain Predictive Ensemble Models.

This paper provides a novel comparison of the behaviour and performance of different building techniques for stacking ensemble models and presents which methods are better for different scenarios. We find that Genetic Programming and Neural Networks are the best models with trained data within single states, and when multiple states are considered Genetic Programming is still better than the Regression models, but Neural Networks fail to estimate the seroprevalence accurately. Another novelty of our work is the use of cross-state validation to evaluate the models with new data, as well as temporal forecasting.

Quality of user Experience (QoE) is a vital quantitative criterion for evaluating user satisfaction while watching live broadcasts, and it is positively correlated with the increase in the income of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Video stalling identification plays a crucial role in the evaluation of QoE. However, encrypted live streaming hides video content, which makes identifying video stalling challenging. Existing studies primarily detect video stalling in a fixed time interval and focus on high-dimensional features. However, the capacity of the client byte buffer is dynamic, resulting in the stalling and non-stalling existing in a certain and fixed stalling time. In addition, the handling time of abundant features causes further latency. We propose Truncation of Dynamic Bytes and non-linear Integrated Modification based on Double Buffers (DB2) to identify video stalling under HTTP-FLV protocol in various network conditions and live types. We pull real-time video to get client buffer parameters and build a dynamic mapping based on the double buffer between network packets and the video playing states. This allows a more objective and precise evaluation of video stalling. We design a new network feature by creating a non-linear relationship between network packets and the client buffer. This is achieved by combining non-linear convergent distribution with basic traffic features. The feature is fed into a lightweight machine learning model to train the classifier, achieving low processing latency and high identification accuracy. The experimental results show that DB2 can achieve 98.91% stalling identification accuracy with 1.256 ms operation time in a mixture of live video types, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. © 2024","HTTP-FLV protocol; Integrated non-linear convergent distribution; Machine learning; Video stalling identification; Web live streaming QoE","Carrier sense multiple access; Hypertext systems; Internet protocols; Internet service providers; Video streaming; Websites; Client buffer; Double buffers; HTTP-FLV protocol; Integrated non-linear convergent distribution; Live streaming; Machine-learning; Non linear; Users' experiences; Video stalling identification; Web live streaming quality of user experience; HTTP","Article","Scopus"

HAR offers a diverse variety of important applications, including healthcare, burglary detection, workplace monitoring, and emergency identification. Traditional recognition approaches rely on extracting handmade features from the obtained data to identify the type of human action. Additionally, the efficacy of these works is dependent upon the specific customized features that are chosen. One potential approach to tackle this issue is to utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically learn the relevant features. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model, WISNet, a custom 1D-CNN approach to recognize six complex human activities: Jogging, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Walking and Climbing Upstairs. The model includes a Convolved Normalized Pooled (CNPM) Block to generate significant features from the initial layers. An Identity and Basic (IDBN) Block is incorporated to extract residual progressive features for capturing complex sequential data dependencies. Channel and Spatial attention (CASb) Block is integrated with the network to prioritize or minimize essential features based on relative weights. The proposed WISNet model achieved an enhanced accuracy and F1-score of 96.41 % and 0.95 for the HAR dataset by surpassing the existing transfer learning architectures such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Recurrent Neural Network (SimpleRNN). By strategically integrating the CNPM, IDBN, and CASb blocks, this study aims to tackle distinct challenges encountered in the classification process by enhancing the discernment of features essential for the precise identification of multi-class human activity recognition. The seamless integration of these blocks within the model plays a pivotal role in elevating the overall performance of the WISNet architecture. The work also validates WISNet with similar open-source datasets (UCI-HAR and KU-HAR) and dissimilar open-source datasets (Sleep state detection, Fall detection, and ECG Heartbeat). © 2024 The Authors","Convolutional neural network; Deep Learning (DL); Human activity recognition; LSTM; Machine learning; Sensors; Smartphone","Deep neural networks; Electrotherapeutics; Image segmentation; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Sleep research; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Human activity recognition; Human activity recognition systems; Machine-learning; Network-based; Neural-networks; Open-source; Short term memory; Smart phones; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Scopus"

Fluctuations in lubrication distribution can cause failures such as excessive thinning and cracks. Predicting these failures in real-time for the entire part is still a very challenging task. Machine learning (ML) based digital twins and advanced computing power offer new ways to analyze manufacturing processes inline in the shortest possible time. This study presents a digital twin for simulating a deep drawing process that incorporates an advanced ML model and optimization algorithm. Convolutional neural networks with RES-SE-U-Net architecture, were used to capture the full friction conditions on the blank. The ML model was trained with data from a calibrated finite element model. The ML model establishes a correlation between the local friction conditions across the blank and the quality of the drawn part. It accurately predicts the geometry and thinning of the formed part in real-time by assessing the friction conditions on the blank. A particle swarm optimization algorithm incorporates the ML model and provides tailored recommendations for adjusting local friction conditions to promptly correct detected quality deviations with minimal amount of additional lubricant. Experiments show that the ML model deployed on an industrial control system can predict part quality in real-time and recommend adjustments in case of quality deviation in 1.6 s.

Drought data is nonstationary and noisy, posing challenges for accurate forecasting. This study proposes a novel hybrid framework integrating TVF-EMD preprocessing, LASSO feature selection and Ensemble Deep RVFL modeling for improved multistep ahead drought prediction. Using decomposed SPEI12 values, six machine-learning techniques (Support Vector Regression (SVR), Simple RVFL, Ensemble Deep RVFL, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), XGBoost, Random Forest (RF)) were applied to forecast the SPEI12 drought index. The present study involved forecasting drought in two Canadian stations located in the eastern region (Charlottetown in Prince Edward Island and Fredericton in New Brunswick), where agriculture is rainfed and mostly affected by drought. The statistical period of 1980–2022 was considered for analysis. Following the decomposition of drought data with TVF-EMD, lagged data was generated using the TVF-EMD results. Training time was decreased by utilizing the Lasso regression feature selection algorithm to select effective inputs. Various statistical measures, including the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R), were employed to assess the precision of the models. The research findings indicated that the TVF-ED-RVFL model achieved the highest level of precision in forecasting multistep ahead (1,3,6 and 12) SPEI12 drought index for both Charlottetown and Fredericton stations. During testing, the TVF-ED-RVFL model predicted 1-month SPEI12 for Charlottetown (R = 0.9995, RMSE = 0.0352) and Fredericton (R = 0.9974, RMSE = 0.0560). For multistep ahead forecasting, the R-values range from 0.9924 for 3-months ahead to 0.9242 for 12-months ahead in Charlottetown and range from 0.9846 for 3-months ahead to 0.8293 for 12-months ahead in Fredericton.

In response, the study extensively explores the design and implementation of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to obtain a comprehensive model of the Transmission Error (TE) in rotating vector reducers, which is a main source of robot motion accuracy errors. The ML models are trained with experimental data obtained from a special purpose test rig, where the reducer is tested under different combinations of input speed, applied load and oil temperature. In the second part of the work, the resulting predictive model, tailored to capture the intricate dynamics of the analyzed reducer, is imported into a programmable logic controller to enable online compensation strategies during the execution of custom motion profiles. Experimental tests are conducted using two distinct motion profiles: one generated with a cycloidal law, typical of industrial machinery, and the other extrapolated from the joints of an industrial robot during a pick-and-place task.

The statistical assessments of kurtosis value (KCLAHE=144.83) compared to the query image (Kquery=131.17) indicate a distribution with more pronounced tails in the CLAHE image, enhancing specific image features. Additionally, increased skewness in the CLAHE image (SCLAHE=5.92) suggests a shift toward higher intensity levels compared to the query image (Squery=4.47), further enhancing discernible image features. Through this incorporation, we carefully retain picture boundaries, boost local contrast, and minimize noise, hence enhancing burn diagnostic accuracy. Statistical analyses, such as kurtosis and skewness analysis, verify the improvements in visible picture aspects, offering significant insights into fundamental texture properties. We increase picture retrieval efficiency by using Bhattacharya coefficients and unique bin analysis, resulting in substantial enhancements in the retrieving score of matched images The ANN successfully differentiates between photos that require grafts and those that do not, providing a speedy and accurate diagnosis for acute burn injuries.

All these characteristics are also present in modern cyber epidemics. Therefore, adapting effective biomedical approaches to epidemic analysis for the investigation of the development of cyber epidemics is a promising scientific research task. The article is dedicated to researching the problem of predicting the development of cyber epidemics at early stages. In such conditions, the available data is scarce, incomplete, and distorted. This situation makes it impossible to use artificial intelligence models for prediction. Therefore, the authors propose an entropy-extreme model, defined within the machine learning paradigm, to address this problem. The model is based on estimating the probability distributions of its controllable parameters from input data, taking into account the variability characteristic of the last ones. The entropy-extreme instance, identified from a set of such distributions, indicates the most uncertain (most negative) trajectory of the investigated process. Numerical methods are used to analyze the generated set of investigated process development trajectories based on the assessments of probability distributions of the controllable parameters and the variability characteristic. The result of the analysis includes characteristic predictive trajectories such as the average and median trajectories from the set, as well as the trajectory corresponding to the standard deviation area of the parameters’ values. Experiments with real data on the infection of Windows-operated devices by various categories of malware showed that the proposed model outperforms the classical competitor (least squares method) in predicting the development of cyber epidemics near the extremum of the time series representing the deployment of such a process over time. Moreover, the proposed model can be applied without any prior hypotheses regarding the probabilistic properties of the available data. © 2024 The Authors","Cyber epidemics; Entropy-extreme model; Machine learning; Malware; Prediction; Qualitative metrics; Small data","Adversarial machine learning; Controllable parameters; Cybe epidemic; Entropy-extreme model; Exponential growth; Machine-learning; Malwares; Probability: distributions; Qualitative metric; Saturation time; Small data; Article; cyber epidemic; cybercrime; data quality; entropy extreme model; least square analysis; machine learning; probability; process development; software; time series analysis; Prediction models","Article","Scopus"

However, there are still some gaps in robustness when it comes to arbitrary scaling and cropping attacks scenarios. In this paper, we propose a robust watermarking method against arbitrary scaling and cropping attacks, which maintains a high image visual quality and can extract the watermark from arbitrary position and size local region of an image. Specifically, the padding operation is used to process the arbitrary resolution image, ensuring that they can be fed into the algorithm. Then the watermark is embedded using the DFT-based polar coordinate mapping method, and finally the resolution is restored to obtain the watermarked image. At the watermark extraction, a machine learning-based scaling parameter estimation method is proposed, which can accurately predict the scaling parameters. At the same time, the padding operation is applied to the attacked image, which can maintain the watermark state in the watermarked image as much as possible and is more conducive to the extraction of the watermark. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed watermarking method, while maintaining the performance of state-of-the-art against arbitrary scaling and cropping attacks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Arbitrary scaling and cropping; Discrete Fourier transform; Machine learning; Robust watermarking","Copyrights; Extraction; Image processing; Image watermarking; Machine learning; Arbitrary scaling and cropping; Cropping attacks; Machine-learning; Performance; Robust watermarking; Scaling attacks; Scaling parameter; Scalings; Watermarked images; Watermarking methods; Discrete Fourier transforms","Article","Scopus"

The prediction task of customer churn becomes more challenging when there is class overlap in the data training. In this research, we suggested a hybrid method based on tabular GANs, called CTGAN-ENN, to address class overlap and imbalanced data in datasets of customers that churn. We used five different customer churn datasets from an open platform. CTGAN is a tabular GAN-based oversampling to address class imbalance but has a class overlap problem. We combined CTGAN with the ENN under-sampling technique to overcome the class overlap. CTGAN-ENN reduced the number of class overlaps by each feature in all datasets.

Nonetheless, the practical utilization of carbon composite faces challenges due to complex experimental methods and imprecise algorithms for inverting material properties. Characterization of full set of stiffness tensor for an anisotropic material in particular orthotropic material can be considered as a complex non-linear inversion problem. The inversion process requires a robust optimization algorithm and forward models. The complexity of this inversion process impedes the practical utility in large-scale automation and in real-time structural health monitoring (SHM) application. To cater this, in this work an advanced probabilistic machine learning framework based on multi-output Gaussian process regression (moGPR) is proposed as an inversion algorithm. The inversion algorithm proposed is based on probabilistic framework that utilises the dispersion of Lamb waves as an input for optimal estimation of stiffness tensor. Experimental measurements of full wavefield data of propagating waves are conducted by scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. Further, an optimal training dataset is generated by employing a forward model based on stiffness matrix method (SMM). In the presence of measurement uncertainties, the effectiveness of the optimal prediction algorithm is showcased through a comparison between the estimated parameter and its ground truth.

This study proposes a hybrid model to forecast the total electrical power load in these plants by leveraging key input variables. Five machine learning algorithms, including Categorical Boosting, Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Support Vector Regression, were employed, with their predictions optimized using the Hunger Games Search algorithm. This integration resulted in five hybrid models, with the combination of Hunger Games Search and Categorical Boosting emerging as the most effective, demonstrating superior performance in test datasets with an R2 value of 0.9735 and a mean absolute error of 2.05525. The Hunger Games Search algorithm enhanced prediction accuracy by fine-tuning core algorithm parameters. Comprehensive case analysis and metric evaluation underscored the efficacy of the proposed model for hourly power load forecasting in Combined Cycle Power Plants, although the hybrid model combining Hunger Games Search and Support Vector Regression exhibited comparatively poorer performance in test datasets with R2 of 0.9551 and a mean absolute error of 2.71211.

This study combined the traditional time domain identification method for dynamic loads and the machine learning method to rapidly identify the wheel-rail forces for rail vehicles and evaluate the operational safety of rail vehicles. Firstly, a vertical dynamic model of rail vehicles considering the nonlinearity of partial suspension parameters was established. The acceleration responses of the axle box and frame under random excitation of the track were calculated by the Runge–Kutta method, with the random noise simulating the actual observation noise as the input for the wheel-rail force identification model. Secondly, in response to the difficulty of identifying lateral wheel-rail forces for rail vehicles, a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) model was introduced to construct relationships between vehicle component responses and lateral wheel-rail forces. Then, the influences of input responses and model parameters on the identification results of lateral wheel-rail forces were analyzed, and the lateral wheel-rail forces under straight and curved negotiation were trained and identified. Finally, a comprehensive identification method of wheel-rail forces for rail vehicles based on time domain and machine learning methods was proposed, which can identify the vertical and lateral wheel-rail forces of each wheelset's left and right wheels. The operational safety indicators, derailment coefficient and wheel unloading rate were verified with a simulation model.

Often, these heuristics exploit structural properties and perform well on selected subsets of the problem space. For example, this is how the two best-known construction heuristics solve the scheduling problem investigated in this study (i.e., the scheduling of parallel serial-batch processing machines with incompatible job families, restricted batch capacities, arbitrary batch capacity demands, and sequence-dependent setup times). However, when the properties change, the performance of one algorithm might decrease, and another algorithm might have been the better choice. To resolve this issue, we propose using Machine Learning to exploit the strengths of different algorithms and to select the probably best-performing algorithm for each problem instance individually. To that, we investigate a variety of methods from the “learning-to-rank” literature and propose several adaptations. Furthermore, because there is no algorithm for the considered scheduling problem that is capable to explore the entire solution space, we developed two Genetic Algorithms for the improvement of initial solutions computed by the selected algorithms. Here, we put special emphasis on ensuring that the solution representation (encoding) reflects the entire solution space and that the operators (e.g., for recombination and mutation) are appropriate to explore and exploit this space completely.

The initial objective involves merging subject matter expertise and clustering techniques exclusively on the process output, here, coating thickness measurements at various positions in the reactor. This approach identifies groups of production runs that share similar qualitative characteristics, such as film mean thickness and standard deviation. In particular, the differences of the outcomes represented by the different clusters can be attributed to differences in specific inputs, indicating that these inputs are potentially critical to the production outcome. Shapley value analysis corroborates the formed hypotheses.

Therefore, it is fundamentally crucial to assess the allergenic potential of chemicals before introducing them into clinical therapeutics. However, assessing the allergenicity of chemical compounds experimentally is time-consuming and costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose M3S-ALG, a novel multi-step stacking strategy (M3S) for rapid and accurate identification of the allergenicity of chemical compounds by using only the SMILES notation. The proposed M3S method involves three steps, as follows. First, ten different balanced datasets were constructed using an under-sampling approach. Second, for each balanced dataset, 144 base-classifiers were trained and optimized to generate the prediction scores of allergenic chemical compounds considered as new probabilistic features. Third, we selected the important probabilistic features and employed them to construct the final stacked model (M3S-ALG). Experimental results show that M3S-ALG outperforms conventional ensemble strategies and its constituent base-classifiers on both the training and independent test datasets. This indicates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed strategy in identifying the allergenicity of chemical compounds. In addition, M3S-ALG exhibited excellent prediction performance compared to existing methods on the independent test dataset, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.877, MCC of 0.712, and AUC of 0.931. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online web server at https://pmlabqsar.pythonanywhere.com/M3SALG.

Predicting OGPR is critical for effective reservoir management and enhancing oil recovery. Traditional methods (TMs) and numerical simulations (NS) often struggle to process and analyze nonlinear, complex, and massive datasets. To avoid these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and machine learning (ML) models have been proposed as an alternative solution due to their high efficiency and rapidity in handling complex data. In this study, a new hybrid model is developed by combining the strengths of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Gradient Boosting (GB), using Linear Regression (LR) as a meta-model by stacking technique. It captures nonlinear relationships effectively and manages outliers, enhancing prediction accuracy. The novelty of this study lies in the hybrid ANN-GB-LR model's ability to integrate various machine learning techniques into a robust framework, leveraging the high learning capacity of ANN, the robust handling of outliers by GB, and the straightforward interpretability of LR. This creative combination handles the limitations of individual models and enhances the general predictive performance. The model was trained and tested using actual field data from the Halewah field in Yemen. Evaluation metrics, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2), were utilized to evaluate and compare the hybrid model with other ML models: Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), LR, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), GB, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The hybrid ANN-GB-LR model achieved superior results, with an R2 of 0.998, an RMSE of 11.06 for oil flow rate predictions, and an R2 of 0.98 and an RMSE of 172.15 for gas flow rate predictions. These results significantly surpass the other models, demonstrating the hybrid model's outstanding ability to capture complex data and provide accurate predictions. The ANN-GB-LR model surpasses Traditional Methods in predicting OGPRs. It shows a strong and reliable tool for optimizing reservoir management.

Multi-view semi-supervised classification has attracted widespread attention because it can exploit multi-view data to optimize the classification performance. However, its methods are often ineffective when facing extremely limited labeled samples. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view semi-supervised classification model via auto-weighted submarkov random walk. The proposed method can utilize similar nodes, spread information among nodes on graphs and exploit multi-view data with less labeled information. Accordingly, it enables an effective exploitation of both a small number of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data by connecting them to designed auxiliary nodes. Furthermore, an ideal weight on the Hellinger distance is allocated to each view data for obtaining a global label indicator matrix, which is expected to be robust to imbalanced classes. Compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments on six widely used datasets are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Machine learning; Markov process; Multi-view learning; Random walk; Semi-supervised classification","Semi-supervised learning; Classification models; Classification performance; Labeled data; Learning tasks; Machine-learning; Multi-view datum; Multi-view learning; Multi-views; Random Walk; Semisupervised classification (SSC); Markov processes","Article","Scopus"

To complement the future performance increases of software running on central processing units (CPUs), explorations of coprocessor usage in data processing hold great potential and interest. Coprocessors are a class of computer processors that supplement CPUs, often improving the execution of certain functions due to architectural design choices. We explore the approach of Services for Optimized Network Inference on Coprocessors (SONIC) and study the deployment of this as-a-service approach in large-scale data processing. In the studies, we take a data processing workflow of the CMS experiment and run the main workflow on CPUs, while offloading several machine learning (ML) inference tasks onto either remote or local coprocessors, specifically graphics processing units (GPUs). With experiments performed at Google Cloud, the Purdue Tier-2 computing center, and combinations of the two, we demonstrate the acceleration of these ML algorithms individually on coprocessors and the corresponding throughput improvement for the entire workflow. This approach can be easily generalized to different types of coprocessors and deployed on local CPUs without decreasing the throughput performance. We emphasize that the SONIC approach enables high coprocessor usage and enables the portability to run workflows on different types of coprocessors. © The Author(s) 2024.","CMS; Machine learning; Offline and computing","","Article","Scopus"

Predicting properties or classes of materials based on minimal input information, such as a chemical formula, can be a useful first step to identify which materials are promising candidates before investing resources. This is particularly desirable when working with complex compounds containing a large variety of elements, such as materials for battery applications. In this paper we show how to classify battery compounds into either charge or discharge formulas, or identify suitable anode or cathode materials, based exclusively on the chemical formulas of materials available in online repositories. Without any structural information, we train high-performing classifiers that can be used to rapidly screen hypothetical materials and assign potential applications. The models are applied to a total of 471 materials from the literature, and deliver a 96% success rate over 80% probability. These methods are general and the workflow can be applied to any complex crystalline materials to predict end-uses in advance of synthesis or simulation, opening up the opportunity for machine learning to use used for research planning, in addition to prediction or inference. © 2024 The Author(s)","Anode; Batteries; Cathode; Charge; Classification; Discharge; Machine learning","Battery; Battery applications; Charge; Chemical compositions; Chemical formulae; Complex materials; Discharge; Machine-learning; Material Informatics; Material-based; Crystalline materials","Article","Scopus"

Multisensory fusion incorporates data from diverse sensors, like radar and cameras, to refine the reliability and accuracy of detection. Further, Radar and camera data fusion refine this process by integrating the unique strength of both technologies, which leverage the radar's proficiency in adverse weather conditions and the camera's high-resolution imaging. This incorporation enhances the object detection systems, which enables them to effectively operate across the spectrum of scenarios, from autonomous vehicles navigating challenging weather to surveillance systems monitoring critical infrastructure. Deep learning (DL), a branch of machine learning (ML), empowers this system with the capability to learn complex representations and patterns directly from the data, which enables them to generalize and adapt to new situations. By integrating the advanced methodology, we can develop strong perception system capable of interpreting and detecting objects accurately in dynamic and diverse environments, from autonomous vehicles navigating urban landscapes to surveillance systems monitoring complex environments. This study designs an Intelligent Algorithm for Enhanced Object Detection Using Deep Learning Approach on the Radar and Camera Data Fusion (IAEOD-DLRCDF) technique. The presented IAEOD-DLRCDF technique uses multi-angle joint calibration where the spatial sparse alignment of the heterogeneous data of the camera and Radar is realized with image falsification disregarded. Besides, the IAEOD-DLRCDF technique applies YOLOv8 object detector for radar and camera target detection individually which are then integrated with the image plane. Moreover, the detected objects are then classified via the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model. Furthermore, the Adam optimizer is used for the optimum hyperparameter selection of the BiLSTM network which results in a better recognition rate. The performance assessment of the IAEOD-DLRCDF method is tested under benchmark dataset. The empirical analysis stated that the IAEOD-DLRCDF method gains better performance over other models. © 2024","Adam optimizer; Data fusion; Deep learning; Machine learning; Object detection; Radar; YOLOv8","Aircraft detection; Critical infrastructures; Sensor data fusion; Adam optimizer; Autonomous Vehicles; Data fusion technique; Deep learning; Intelligent Algorithms; Learning approach; Machine-learning; Objects detection; Optimizers; YOLOv8; Deep learning","Article","Scopus"

However, neither generalizability nor scalability of computer-vision-based surgical guidance systems have been demonstrated, especially to geographic locations that lack hardware and infrastructure necessary for real-time inference. We propose a new equipment-agnostic framework for real-time use in operating suites. Using laparoscopic cholecystectomy and semantic segmentation models for predicting safe/dangerous (“Go”/”No-Go”) zones of dissection as an example use case, this study aimed to develop and test the performance of a novel data pipeline linked to a web-platform that enables real-time deployment from any edge device. To test this infrastructure and demonstrate its scalability and generalizability, lightweight U-Net and SegFormer models were trained on annotated frames from a large and diverse multicenter dataset from 136 institutions, and then tested on a separate prospectively collected dataset. A web-platform was created to enable real-time inference on any surgical video stream, and performance was tested on and optimized for a range of network speeds. The U-Net and SegFormer models respectively achieved mean Dice scores of 57% and 60%, precision 45% and 53%, and recall 82% and 75% for predicting the Go zone, and mean Dice scores of 76% and 76%, precision 68% and 68%, and recall 92% and 92% for predicting the No-Go zone. After optimization of the client-server interaction over the network, we deliver a prediction stream of at least 60 fps and with a maximum round-trip delay of 70 ms for speeds above 8 Mbps. Clinical deployment of machine learning models for surgical guidance is feasible and cost-effective using a generalizable, scalable and equipment-agnostic framework that lacks dependency on hardware with high computing performance or ultra-fast internet connection speed. © The Author(s) 2024.","","Digital storage; Fluorescent screens; Steganography; Surgical equipment; Transplantation (surgical); Video streaming; Decision supports; Geographic location; Guidance system; Performance; Real- time; Real-time inference; Scalings; Surgical guidance; Time use; Vision based; Article; artificial intelligence; computer vision; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; decision support system; deep learning; deep neural network; human; Internet; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; machine learning; operation duration; performance; scoring system; Semantic Segmentation","Article","Scopus"

Over the past decade, researchers have introduced numerous methods for TSC, necessitating not only algorithmic development and analysis but also validation and empirical comparison. This dual approach holds substantial value for practitioners by streamlining choices and revealing insights into models’ strengths and weaknesses. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by providing a rigorous experimental evaluation of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for TSC tasks in manufacturing and industrial settings. We first explored and compiled a comprehensive list of more than 92 state-of-the-art algorithms from both TSC and manufacturing literature. Following this, we methodologically selected the 36 most representative algorithms from this list. To evaluate their performance across various manufacturing classification tasks, we curated a set of 22 manufacturing datasets, representative of different characteristics that cover diverse manufacturing problems. Subsequently, we implemented and evaluated the algorithms on the manufacturing benchmark datasets, and analyzed the results for each dataset. Based on the results, ResNet, DrCIF, InceptionTime, and ARSENAL emerged as the top-performing algorithms, boasting an average accuracy of over 96.6 % across all 22 manufacturing TSC datasets. These findings underscore the robustness, efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of convolutional kernels in capturing temporal features in time-series data collected from manufacturing systems for TSC tasks, as three out of the top four performing algorithms leverage these kernels for feature extraction. Additionally, LSTM, BiLSTM, and TS-LSTM algorithms deserve recognition for their effectiveness in capturing features within manufacturing time-series data using RNN-based structures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","AI; Industry 4.0; Machine learning; Smart manufacturing; Time-series classification","Classification (of information); Engineering education; Flow control; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Time series; Classification tasks; Experimental evaluation; Machine learning algorithms; Machine-learning; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing time; Smart manufacturing; State of the art; Time series classifications; Time-series data; Industry 4.0","Article","Scopus"

As it continues to evolve and shape our lives, it is important to consider both the benefits and the potential risks of these platforms. One of these risks is the spread of misinformation over global platforms like Twitter. The rapid dissemination of false information can have far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion and potentially leading to real-world harm. One critical area of concern is the impact of fake news on mental health and well-being. This study aims to explore the emotional responses elicited by fake news and provide insights into the psychological effects of false information circulated through social media. To achieve this, a novel Ensemble Hard Voting Classifier (EHVC), which accurately classifies tweets as either fake or real with an accuracy of 93.84% has been developed. Additionally, sentiment analysis has been conducted, yielding an accuracy of 83.02%. These two stand-alone models are then integrated into a unified architecture that analyzes the sentiments triggered by fake news in real-time using the Twitter API. Additionally, this research validates the significance of the relationship between fake news and sentiments in order to substantiate that degrading mental health is a direct consequence of fake news by employing the Pearson’s Chi-Squared test for independence. The proposed methodology results have also been compared and analyzed against conventional machine learning algorithms to demonstrate the efficacy of the EHVC model.

These models are typically composed of a large number of 2D convolutional (Conv2D) layers with numerous trainable parameters. To manage the complexity of such networks, compression techniques can be applied, which typically rely on the analysis of trained deep learning models. However, in certain situations, training a new CNN from scratch may be infeasible due to resource limitations. In this paper, we propose an alternative parameterization to Conv2D filters with significantly fewer parameters without relying on compressing a pre-trained CNN. Our analysis reveals that the effective rank of the vectorized Conv2D filters decreases with respect to the increasing depth in the network. This leads to the development of the Depthwise Convolutional Eigen-Filter (DeCEF) layer, which is a low rank version of the Conv2D layer with significantly fewer trainable parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs). The way we define the effective rank is different from previous work, and it is easy to implement and interpret. Applying this technique is straightforward – one can simply replace any standard convolutional layer with a DeCEF layer in a CNN. To evaluate the effectiveness of DeCEF layers, experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets CIFAR-10 and ImageNet for various network architectures. The results have shown a similar or higher accuracy using about 2/3 of the original parameters and reducing the number of FLOPs to 2/3 of the base network. Additionally, analyzing the patterns in the effective rank provides insights into the inner workings of CNNs and highlights opportunities for future research. © 2024 The Author(s)","Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Efficient network; Low rank approximation; Network complexity; Subspace method","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Wiener filtering; Compression techniques; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Efficient network; Filter layers; Floating point operations; Low rank approximations; Network complexity; Network compression; Subspace method; Article; artificial intelligence; classification algorithm; compression; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; depthwise convolutional eigen filter; genetic algorithm; histogram; human; imagery; machine learning; residual neural network; training; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Scopus"

The focus is, specifically, on problems characterized by multiple pricing problems. Pricing problems often constitute a substantial portion of CPU time due to their repetitive nature. The primary contribution of this work includes the introduction of a machine learning-based ranker that strategically guides the search for new columns in the column generation process. The master problem solution is analyzed by the ranker, which then suggests an order for solving the pricing problems to prioritize those with the potential to improve the master problem the most. This prioritization mechanism is essential in speeding up the column generation since, by identifying new columns early in the process, we can terminate the search procedure sooner. Furthermore, our technique exhibits applicability across all nodes of the branching tree, making it a valuable tool for solving a wide range of optimization problems. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the challenging domain of operating room scheduling, an area that has seen limited exploration in the context of machine learning.

In this paper, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm proposed to improve the accuracy of emotion classification using EEG signals, aligned with decreasing the input dimension to reduce computations, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We performed two experiments utilizing the DEAP and the MAHNOB-HCI datasets. Various features were extracted and employed for emotion classification using SVM, KNN, and XGBoost classifiers. Initially, the highest accuracy for binary emotion classification in the DEAP dataset was achieved with statistical features and the XGBoost model, reaching 78.85% for arousal and 79.02% for valence. In the MAHNOB-HCI dataset, the highest accuracy with statistical features and the XGBoost model was 67.08% for arousal and 62.24% for valence. Subsequently, we applied the grey wolf optimization algorithm as a feature selection method, optimizing the cost function based on XGBoost accuracy. This approach significantly enhanced the classification performance. For the DEAP dataset, accuracy increased to 89.63% for arousal and 89.08% for valence using statistical features.

The proposed approach, SENTINEY (Securing ENcrypted mulTIparty computatIoN for Enhanced data privacY and phishing detection), combines unsupervised machine learning and string matching techniques to detect phishing links over encrypted data, making it adaptive. Subsequently, an adaptive system dynamically selects the appropriate phishing detection technique taking into account various factors (e.g, the volume of new attacks, the accuracy of the machine learning model, attack specificity and available system resources) is suggested. For efficiency reasons, the learning model uses network virtualization features to improve computational resources. This new approach has shown good performance in taking advantage of network virtualization to create a secure and collaborative environment for the SMPC. The dataset used to train and test the proposal is generated on the basis of real phishing emails, including real phishing URLs and keywords. An in-depth performance analysis evaluated the performance of the proposed approach in terms of efficiency (processing time) and robustness (accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score).

These methods are derived from mechanics principles embedded in FEA. They progressively remove underutilized material and keep material that represents load paths. However, they produce organic shapes that may be non-manufacturable and are not easily converted to parametric CAD models for size optimization. Consequently, many designers start with proven past designs that may already be in the form of parametric CAD and modify them to new specifications. The first approach is purely analytical, while the second uses experiential knowledge. This paper presents a methodology to combine the advantages of both, as follows. Two large data sets are artificially curated, one generated from existing designs (parametric CAD) and the second from ""fuzzification"" of those designs to resemble features in topology-optimized meshes. An algorithm is trained to match feature patterns of a given TopOpt mesh to members of the fuzzy data set. Now, assume that the designer starts by performing topology optimization of a new component of the same type. The trained algorithm is used to find the closest matches of that design in the fuzzy set, which relates to the seed design in the parametric data set. Finally, the feature pattern found is conformal mapped to the geometry of the new design. While this methodology is primarily demonstrated using automotive hood frames, it can be generalized to any sheet metal component.

The five-year survival rate after diagnosis is less than 10%. However, if diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate can reach up to 70%. Early diagnosis of PDAC can aid treatment and improve survival rates by taking necessary precautions. The challenge is to develop a reliable, data privacy-aware machine learning approach that can accurately diagnose pancreatic cancer with biomarkers. Aim: The study aims to diagnose a patient’s pancreatic cancer while ensuring the confidentiality of patient records. In addition, the study aims to guide researchers and clinicians in developing innovative methods for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Methods: Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns by analyzing large datasets. The study pre-processed a dataset containing urine biomarkers with operations such as filling in missing values, cleaning outliers, and feature selection. The data was encrypted using the Fernet encryption algorithm to ensure confidentiality. Ten separate machine learning models were applied to predict individuals with PDAC. Performance metrics such as F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy were used in the modeling process. Results: Among the 590 clinical records analyzed, 199 (33.7%) belonged to patients with pancreatic cancer, 208 (35.3%) to patients with non-cancerous pancreatic disorders (such as benign hepatobiliary disease), and 183 (31%) to healthy individuals. The LGBM algorithm showed the highest efficiency by achieving an accuracy of 98.8%. The accuracy of the other algorithms ranged from 98 to 86%. In order to understand which features are more critical and which data the model is based on, the analysis found that the features “plasma_CA19_9”, REG1A, TFF1, and LYVE1 have high importance levels. The LIME analysis also analyzed which features of the model are important in the decision-making process.

Traditional linear regression methods have shown success, but their reliance on individual-level imaging and genetic data limits their applicability. Herein, we proposed S-GsMTLR, a group sparse multi-task linear regression method designed to harness summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of neuroimaging quantitative traits. S-GsMTLR directly employs GWAS summary statistics, bypassing the requirement for raw imaging genetic data, and applies multivariate multi-task sparse learning to these univariate GWAS results. It amalgamates the strengths of conventional sparse learning methods, including sophisticated modeling techniques and efficient feature selection. Additionally, we implemented a rapid optimization strategy to alleviate computational burdens by identifying genetic variants associated with phenotypes of interest across the entire chromosome. We first evaluated S-GsMTLR using summary statistics derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The results were remarkably encouraging, demonstrating its comparability to conventional methods in modeling and identification of risk loci. Furthermore, our method was evaluated with two additional GWAS summary statistics datasets: One focused on white matter microstructures and the other on whole brain imaging phenotypes, where the original individual-level data was unavailable. The results not only highlighted S-GsMTLR's ability to pinpoint significant loci but also revealed intriguing structures within genetic variations and loci that went unnoticed by GWAS. These findings suggest that S-GsMTLR is a promising multivariate sparse learning method in brain imaging genetics. It eliminates the need for original individual-level imaging and genetic data while demonstrating commendable modeling and feature selection capabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)","Brain imaging genetics; Feature selection; Machine learning; Sparse multi-task learning; Summary statistics","Adversarial machine learning; Brain mapping; Contrastive Learning; Feature Selection; Federated learning; florbetapir f 18; Brain imaging; Brain imaging genetic; Features selection; Genome-wide association studies; Imaging genetics; Individual levels; Machine-learning; Multitask learning; Sparse multi-task learning; Summary statistic; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; Caucasian; chromosome 19; chromosome 5; chromosome analysis; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; female; Gaussian noise; gene expression level; gene expression profiling; gene locus; genetic identification; genetic risk; genetic variability; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; group sparse multi task linear regression; haplotype; human; imaging genetics; learning algorithm; left handedness; left hippocampus; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mean diffusivity; medial orbitofrontal cortex; middle frontal gyrus; neuroimaging; phenotype; positron emission tomography; quality control; quantitative analysis; radial diffusivity; right handedness; right hippocampus; single nucleotide polymorphism; superior frontal gyrus; susceptibility weighted imaging; white matter; Multi-task learning","Article","Scopus"

However, unreliable or potentially incorrect pseudo-labels can accumulate training errors during iterative self-training steps, leading to unstable performance. Addressing this challenge typically involves either discarding unreliable pseudo-labels, resulting in the loss of important data, or attempting to refine them, risking the possibility of worsening the pseudo-labels in some cases/pixels. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised segmentation of medical images. Unlike existing approaches, our method neither discards any data nor worsens reliable pseudo-labels. Our approach generates uncertainty masks for the predictions, utilizing reliable pixels without any modification as ground truths and modifying the unreliable ones rather than discarding them. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function that incorporates both mentioned parts by multiplying each term by its corresponding uncertainty mask, encompassing reliable and unreliable pixels. The reliable pixels are addressed using a masked cross-entropy loss function, while the modification of the unreliable pixels is performed through a deep-learning-based adaptation of active contours. The entire process is solved within a single loss function without the need to solve traditional active contour equations. We evaluated our approach on three publicly available datasets, including MRI and CT images from cardiac structures and lung tissue. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods on all three datasets.

Existing approaches focus on extracting and leveraging the hidden logical structures within text. However, previous works explore partial logical relationships and neglect the holistic extraction within the text. Moreover, they struggle to fully model logical connections, including long-distance dependencies and local topology information. To address these issues, we propose a novel heterogeneous-branch integration framework. Our framework is based on first-order predicate logic theory and consists of three primary components. First, we construct two heterogeneous logical graphs to model logical relationships within and between propositions. Second, we propose a novel Graph-Masked Transformer with a novel graph-masked multi-head attention mechanism to enable distant node interactions and local sparse relationship modeling. Third, we propose a novel multi-branch fusion module to integrate information from multiple sources and generate answer predictions. The proposed heterogeneous-branch integration framework outperforms the VDGN method by 2.73% in accuracy on the ReClor dataset and 2.15% on the LogiQA dataset.
